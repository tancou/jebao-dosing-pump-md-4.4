Library to interact locally with Jebao Dosing Pump MD 4.4

A special thanks to Apollon77, whose work laid the foundation for this current project. [His work](https://github.com/Apollon77/node-ph803w)

## Device details

The Jebao Dosing Pump MD 4.4 device is internally an ESP which uses the GizWits platform. With this the device offers two ways of communication:
* The device connects to the gizwits cloud via MQTT and publishs the device data there, where the Android app gets the data from
* The device also offers local options via UDP for discovery and setup (Onboarding) and also a TCP interface for communication with the device and to request data

This library is focussing on the local LAN interface via UDP and TCP.

## LAN communication protocol

Please see [Protocol page](PROTOCOL.md).

## Usage

The library is documented in code (Apidoc) and example scripts show the usage

Available examples (see example folder):
* data.js: Script to connect to a device via IP, authenticate and retrieve data
* discovery.js: Script to discover devices in the network

## Todo

- Add send command tests
- Improve Protocol.md file
- Create a function to create custom send request instead of hard written strings
- Reverse cron requests
- Reverse calibration command
